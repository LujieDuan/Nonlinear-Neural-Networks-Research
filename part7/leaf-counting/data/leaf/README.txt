I. INTRODUCTION

We present a collection of benchmark datasets in the context of plant phenotyping. We provide annotated imaging data and suggest suitable evaluation criteria for plant/leaf segmentation, detection, tracking as well as classification and regression problems. The data is available together with ground truth segmentations and further annotations and metadata.

The Plant Phenotyping Datasets are intended for the development and evaluation of computer vision and machine learning algorithms such as (in parentheses we point to general category of computer vision problems that these datasets can also be used for):
- plant detection and localization (multi-instance detection/localization);
- plant segmentation (foreground to background segmentation);
- leaf detection, localization, and counting (multi-instance detection, object counting);
- leaf segmentation (multi-instance segmentation);
- leaf tracking (multi-instance segmentation);
- boundary estimation for multi-instance segmentation (boundary detectors);
- classification and regression of mutants and treatments (general classification recognition).
The data can be used by scientists that already work in related fields but also from general computer vision scientists that work in related computer vision problems. No matter what, testing your algorithms on these data, you help us improve the state-of-the-art in phenotyping and feed the world one image at a time.



II. STRUCTURE OF THE DATASET

Image data are divided into three groups:
- Plant: color images of single plants accompanied by annotations (leaf segmentation masks, leaf bounding boxes, leaf centers, leaf boundaries) and possibly metadata;
- Stacks: time series of single plant images accompanied by time-consistent annotations (leaf segmentation masks, leaf bounding boxes);
- Tray: color images of trays including multiple plants accompanied by annotations (plant segmentation masks, plant bounding boxes).

The mapping between vision tasks and files in the dataset is as follows.

Additional notes on the CSV files.
CSV files containing leaf or plant bounding box annotations (*_bbox.csv) report bounding box coordinates of the four corners in the following order: c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, c3x, c3y, c4x, c4y.
CSV files containing leaf counts (Leaf_counts.csv) report: file ID, number of leaves.
CSV files containing plant metadata (Metadata.csv) report: file ID, genotype, treatment, time after germination (hours).
