# Research on Neural Networks with Nonlinear Synapses

##  Part 1:

Benchmark on two linear algebra libraries setup: Numpy with Python, and Breeze with Scala. 

The operations that we used the most in a neural networks are matrix multiplication, matrix apply (apply operation elementwise), and matrix dot multiplication (elementwise multiplication). 

##  part 2:
