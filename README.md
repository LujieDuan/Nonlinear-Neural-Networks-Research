# Research on Neural Networks with Nonlinear Synapses

##  Part 1:

Benchmark on two linear algebra libraries setup: Numpy with Python, and Breeze with Scala. 

The operations that we used the most in a neural networks are matrix multiplication, matrix apply (apply operation elementwise), and matrix dot multiplication (elementwise multiplication). 



##  Part 2: 

A Python/Numpy implementation of ordinary linear neural networks, and a corresponding sequential implementation in Scala/Breeze; both trained on MNIST handwritten digit database. 


##	Part 3:

A Scala/Breeze implementation of neural networks with nonlinear synapses, trained on MNIST handwritten digit database.
